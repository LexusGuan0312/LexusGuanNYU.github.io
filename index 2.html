       <div id="Introduction">
        The hottest k-pop girls group in Korea, BLACKPINK, is having
        their international worldwide tour in the U.S. now.
        BLACKPINK stands out among other girls group not only due
        to the marketing strategies of their agent and record company,
        they are also good at their girl-crush style and each member has
        their unique talent and remembering icon. It took just four years for Blackpink to become one of the
        biggest girl bands in the world, with members Jennie, Jisoo,
        Rosé and Lisa continuing to smash new records and forge new
        ground. They were the first K-pop girl group to play at
        Coachella and to reach 1bn YouTube views—now they are
        the most-subscribed-to music group on the platform.
        Why succeed:
        
        YG has their unique ways to market BLACKPINK and
        makes them distinctive from other local Korean girls group,
        and the main strategy that YG embraces is called Scarcity.
        BLACKPINK is lack of the comeback music and they only
        have their comeback shows every eight months. The hunger
        marketing makes BLACKPINK mysterious, and their
        comeback show will always spur great public attention and
        discussion about their fantastic music production and the
        world class visuals(attract people in all tastes).
        (visual)
        
        Authenticity:
        They have their worldwide tour not only in the U.S. bus also in
        China, and they also engage in the reality shows on TV and
        communicate with their fans both on Instagram and in real life.
        Being authentic both on social media and real life has increased
        their popularity worldwide and their fans(BLINKS) are so loyal
        to them like purchasing the tickets of their tour showcase,
        purchasing the BLINK products like pink hammer, or even
        waiting in the airport in order to say “hi” to them. Lisa
        is the youngest member of the group who is born in 1997,
        Thailand, and she is the only foreign member in the group who
        wins the audition in Thailand in 2010 among 4000 applicants.
        Lisa is known as her title “human barbie” as her barbie doll look
        and she is the main dancer and rapper in the group. Lisa has
        published a lot of solo dance videos and are welcomed and
        acknowledged by the dancers worldwide.
       
        Jennie : Jennie has lived in New Zealand from nine years old
        and dreamed of becoming a ballet dancer.She has been trained
        for more than 5 years and is famous for her fabulous outfit and
        body shape. Jennie is the first member who released her solo
        song named “SOLO”, and she also acts in the upcoming
        American TV series called “The idol”. And Jennie is also the
        ambassador of Chanel and known as “Human Chanel” and
        “Human GUCCI”.
        
        Rose: Rose was born in New Zealand and at the age of seven,
        Rose move to Australia. In 2015, for the audition to join YG
        Entertainment by her father's suggestion, she went to South
        Korea and succeeded to join among 700 participants, Rose
        then moved to South Korea.
        
        Rose received a reputation of her singing is in a heartbeat and
        unique, and YG Label Entertainment announced that Rose will
        solo debut in September 2020, following the release of
        Blackpink's first full album.
        
        JISSO: Jisoo joined YG Entertainment in 2011 and acted in a
        number of music videos and commercials in her pre-Blackpink
        years. She is often referred to as Blackpink's mood-maker.
        And famous for her beautiful classical Korean face.
        
        Being a trainee and finally get into the k-pop business is not as
        easy as what we think. The k-pop idols need to experience
        more than 5 years of training and face the severe judgement of
        their company.
        
        
        According to the interview of four blackpink members, they
        talked about the relentless rules of the company and they
        would face the leave of the members each month based on
        the grade of their monthly test. And they also need to lose
        weight, practice till the midnight, and face the criticism of the
        company if they did not do well in their solo or group
        performance.
        
        Their experience reminds me of my own trainee experience
        in China when I got into an entertainment company with
        other girls who have the same dream as me. Being a trainee
        and perform on the stage is not like what we can see in the
        videos that those girls can wear fabulous clothes, show the
        best of their practice and enjoy the compliment of their fans.
        We have to get up early in the morning and work out, and
        take the dancing classes in the afternoon as well as the
        singing class, and we need to do the group dance practice at
        night. We need to continue this routine again and again and
        finally get the chance to perform in front of our fans.
        

        Therefore, based on the success of BLACKPINK, we not
        only need to consider the marketing strategies applied by
        their agent and record company, we also have to think about
        the effort they devoted to their whole performing life as they
        made their dream come true among the other thousands of
        girls.
        And finally I hope everyone achieves their dreams and thank
        you for watching. </div>
